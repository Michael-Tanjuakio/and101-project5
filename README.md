# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Michael Tanjuakio**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Bored App** is an android app that displays a random thing to do if you are bored using the Bored API.
You can also pick a specific category of things to do if you're bored.
Such as something recreational, educational, or diy!

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **a random thing to do in a specific category**
- [x] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] View Binding!

## API Choice

## Notes

This app was the most difficult app in the course of my Codepath projects I had to make. 
I had a hard time figuring out what API to use and how to parse json files.
There were some test cases that were challenging such as when the http request doesn't work,
or if it did work but it wasn't supposed to. 
Overall, I learned alot and would like to tackle more api projects soon.
